# Where We Work

## Office

Box Products HQ exists solely in our heart at the moment. We might have a dedicated space one day but as a company we have a remote first mindset so a dedicated spot isn't high on the list just yet. Our Parent company does has offices in Grapevine, Texas, which is also where Jono is based.

## From home

Most people at Box Products work from home most of the time. You can spend up to \$1,000 every three years outfitting your home office. Getting the basics right will make a big difference: a good chair and a good desk.

## From coffee shops

Working from home all the time isn't everyone's cup of coffee. Thus, lots of us choose to work from coffee shops or other third spaces either some of the time or a lot of the time. Great for a buzz of other people and much-needed [caffeine](https://giphy.com/gifs/bobs-burgers-fox-bobs-burgers-tv-3o72F3CQSLwU7XTlDy) of course.

## From a co-working space

If working from home or from a coffee shop doesn't suit you, then trying a co-working space might just do the trick. Box Products offers a \$200/month stipend towards a desk in such a place.
