# Where We Work

## Office

The Basecamp HQ is in Chicago, in the West Loop neighborhood. Thirteen people and one frog have desk space in the Chicago office, but those people also work from home regularly. We moved into the office in August 2010, and before that, 37signals shared space with our friends at [Coudal Partners](http://www.coudal.com). The office is also where we twice a year gather the whole company for the meet-up.

Anyone is welcome to visit Chicago and work from the office at any time.

## From home

Most people at Basecamp work from home most of the time. You can spend up to $1,000 every three years outfitting your home office. Getting the basics right will make a big difference: a good chair and a good desk.

## From coffee shops

Working from home all the time isn't everyone's cup of coffee. Thus, lots of us choose to work from coffee shops or other third spaces either some of the time or a lot of the time. Great for a buzz of other people and much-needed [caffeine](https://giphy.com/gifs/bobs-burgers-fox-bobs-burgers-tv-3o72F3CQSLwU7XTlDy) of course, but please do mind our [basic security rules](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/34/documents/14419) and procedures to ensure that nothing leaks on to the cafe wifi.

## From a coworking space

If working from home or from a coffee shop doesn't suit you, then trying a coworking space might just do the trick. Basecamp offers a $200/month stipend towards a desk in such a place.
