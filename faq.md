# Frequently Asked Questions

## Where should I report a bug?

Salt is currently the only product that we're actively fixing functionality bugs on. If you find a bug in Salt, please add a new todo to the Awaiting Triage todolist in [Salt: Bugs](https://3.basecamp.com/4261627/buckets/14118797/todolists/2137881689). It's a good idea to try to do a quick search first to see if your bug has already been reported, but better to report something twice than not at all.
