Everyone working at Box Products represents Box Products. When a customer gets a response from Blake on support, Blake
is Box Products. When a customer reads a tweet by Jonathan that our systems are down, Jonathan is Box Products. In those
situations, all the other stuff we do to cultivate our best image is secondary. What’s right in front of someone in a
time of need is what they’ll remember.

That’s what we mean when we say marketing is everyone’s responsibility, and that it pays to spend the time to recognize
that. This means avoiding the [bullshit of outage
language](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1528-the-bullshit-of-outage-language) and [bending our policies, not just
lending your ears](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3513-when-empathy-becomes-insulting). It means taking the time to get
the writing right and consider how you’d feel if you were on the other side of the interaction.

It's also worth mentioning that joining a company with a strong culture like Box Products can be all-consuming. We all
joined because we agree with what Box Products stand for, but that can lead feeling pressure to contribute, maybe
overwhelmingly so. The people who work here are some of the best and brightest in our industry, so the self-imposed
burden to be exceptional is real. But here's the thing: stop it. Settle in. We're glad you love this job because we all
do too, but at the end of the day it's a job. Do your best work, collaborate with your team, write, read, learn, and
then turn off your computer and play with your dog. We'll all be better for it.
