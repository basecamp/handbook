# Titles for Programmers

## Programming Management

On Web and [SIP (Security, Infrastructure, and Performance)](https://dev.37signals.com/navigating-personal-information-with-care/) programming teams, Lead Programmers (L4) and Principal Programmers (L5) act as tech leads to Junior - Senior Programmers (L1-3). All Leads and Principals report directly to our CTO. Tech leads are responsible for:
- Reviewing a report's substantial PRs before they're shipped.
- Having a kick-off conversation with a report on every substantial project.
- Reviewing a report's on-call work and handoff after every shift.
- Providing People Ops with the key input to annual performance reviews.
- Identifying and escalating slips in performance or process to People Ops.

A tech lead on the SIP team also acts as SIP Coordinator. They're responsible for setting cycle priorities, liaising with other project teams, and maintaining general oversight of team resources.

Our Mobile programming teams (iOS and Android) have 1 manager overseeing both teams who is responsible for technical leadership and people management.
