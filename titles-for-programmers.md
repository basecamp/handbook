# Titles for programmers

We use the following criteria to assess the level and title of programmers of Basecamp. These criteria aren't exhaustive, and they aren't mere checklists. They're a guidance to having an individualized discussion about career progression.

It should also be noted that these criteria chiefly examine the scope of work someone is capable of tackling independently. In addition to that assessment, we also look at the quality of the execution itself. Basecamp pays in the top 10% of the industry (based on San Francisco rates), so the quality of the work itself should be commensurate with that target.
