# Overgrad's History

Overgrad was started in late 2012 by Ryan Hoch and Kevin Hoffman who graduated together from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as General Engineers. The company was founded to solve a problem Ryan had experienced while teaching high school juniors at seniors in St. Louis Public Schools with Teach For America.

The first question Ryan asked his students was "who wants to go to college?" and 90% of them eagerly put their hands in the air. He then asked where they wanted to go and they shouted "SLU", "Mizzou!" and "Wash U". Knowing how competitive these schools were, Ryan gave his students a practice ACT to see where they were at as admissions season wasn't far away for his students. To his dismay, the average ACT score for his students was a 15 and the average GPA was a 2.5. To make matters worse, at the time, St. Louis Public Schools had an 8% college completion rate.

Ryan felt his students had been sold a dream of "if you dream it, you could do it" without being given the information necessary to what it would take to achieve their dreams. So Kevin and Ryan connected and decided they wanted to solve this problem, and Overgrad was born.

It has been a long road since as Overgrad has gone through many ups and downs. Our turning point came in 2017 when we just stopped and listened to our customers. Sounds simple, right? They helped us identify the real problems and guided our product roadmap. That is why, to this day, we value wowing our customers over everything else, because we owe our success to them and they deserve our best.
