If you want to learn the Box Products view of the world, it helps to know the influences that helped form it. Box Products, is a brand new company but Jonathan has been in product and software development for over 10 years. Since then there's been a number of key influencers that have marked the company culture.

## Companies

They've challenged the status quo and be more successfully than most startups all while maintaining a vibrate happy team. This team, and particularly DHH and Jason are a huge inspiration for a large portion of what we do today.

> The perspective gained from examining how these two lead at Basecamp has change the course of my career. - Jonathan
