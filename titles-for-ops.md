# Titles for Ops

We use the following criteria to assess the level and title of ops at Basecamp. These criteria aren't exhaustive, and they aren't mere checklists. The criteria outline the minimum shape, of what it is work a given level on the Ops team at Basecamp.

It should also be noted that these criteria chiefly examine the scope of work someone is capable of tackling independently. In addition to that assessment, we also look at the consistency and quality of the execution itself. Basecamp pays in the top 10% of the industry (based on San Francisco rates), so the quality of the work itself should be commensurate with that target.
