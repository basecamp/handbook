# Overgrad Employee Handbook

Welcome to our handbook. I want to first shoutout another Chicago-area company, Basecamp, for the inspiration to opensource our handbook.

At Overgrad, we value openness and transparency. We also value radical candor, so please give us feedback as this handbook is far from a finished product.

If you are interested in giving super powers to school counselors, check out our job postings on AngelList.
