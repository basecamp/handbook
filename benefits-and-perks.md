Since the majority of Box Products employees work in the US, this section is written with that as the default. Some
benefits don't make sense in other countries, like private health insurance in other first-world countries with a
well-functioning, national health care system. We will try our best to provide comparable benefits and perks outside the
US as it makes sense, though.

## Benefits

### Health Insurance

Our health insurance is currently centralized under our parent company. This means that the terms and details are not
quite what we'd like them to be but we're working to improve them as often as possible.

#### Medical Insurance

Medical insurance is provided in the US via Cigna PPO. At this time, the company pays varying range from 50-75% of the
premium depending on tier and the employee pays the remaining 50-25%. Open enrollment is in November every year, with
new coverage beginning December 1\. Marriages and domestic partnerships are covered equally.

Employee-portion of medical insurance premium per pay period:

- Employee-only medical coverage: \$42.65
- Employee-partner medical coverage: \$92.57
- Employee-child(ren) medical coverage: TBD
- Employee-family medical coverage: \$309.47

#### Dental Insurance

Dental insurance is provided in the US via Principal. There is no company contribution at this time. Open enrollment is
in November every year, with new coverage beginning December 1\. Marriages and domestic partnerships are covered
equally.

Employee-portion of dental insurance premium per pay period:

- Employee-only dental: \$21.20
- Employee-partner dental: \$43.39
- Employee-child(ren) dental: \$44.03
- Employee-family dental: \$68.41

#### Vision Insurance

Vision insurance is provided in the US via Principal. There is no company contribution at this time. Open enrollment is
in November every year, with new coverage beginning December 1\. Marriages and domestic partnerships are covered
equally.

Employee-portion of vision insurance premium per pay period:

- Employee-only vision: \$2.63
- Employee-partner vision: \$6.83
- Employee-child(ren) vision: \$7.39
- Employee-family vision: \$11.59

### Paid Time Off

Box Products offers 3 weeks of paid vacation, a few extra personal days to use at your discretion, and the standard
national holidays every year. This is a guideline, so if you need a couple extra days, no problem. We don’t track your
days off; we use the honor system. Just make sure to check with your team before taking any extended absence, so they’re
not left in the lurch.

We don't track sick days either. If you're under the weather, take the time you need to feel better. Box Products
recognizes, too, that your mental health is just as important as your physical health. Consider taking a mental health
day every now and again when you're feeling overwhelmed or mentally fatigued. If a day or two won't cut it, we'll work
with you to find a way to reduce the burden of your work at Box Products on your overall mental health. We really do
want your work at Box Products to be the best work you do in your life, and we appreciate that that's not possible if
you're uncertain about your health.

You can go to Jonathan at any time, who with your permission can work with your manager to help you. Additionally, your
manager should check in with _you_, proactively, to periodically make sure you're doing okay.

### Personal Leave

If you are under treatment or recovery for a serious medical condition and are unable to work because of it, let us know
and you can take four weeks off at 100% pay. If after that, you're still unable to work, Box Products will continue to
pay you 70% of your pay until you're better, up to twelve weeks off. These days are an emergency reserve, separate from
your vacation/sick time described above. If after this period of time, you still cannot work, talk to your manager or
Jonathan, and we will discuss what comes next on a case-by-case basis.

### Summer Hours

During summer, we work 4-day work weeks, aka "summer hours". Summer hours are in effect from May 1 through August 31
each year. (An employee who has just been hired may have to complete a training program per their team lead to be
eligible). Summer weeks are 4-day work weeks, so when a holiday occurs over summer, you can take the holiday off _or_
your normal summer day off. Any additional days off would count as vacation days.

### Sabbatical

Every three years, employees are eligible to take a one-month-long paid sabbatical. Just give a heads-up preferably
three months in advance, so we can coordinate the work-load accordingly.

### Family Leave

If you are the primary caregiver of a new child, you can take up to 16 weeks leave at 100% paid salary. If you are the
secondary caregiver of a new child, you can take up to 6 weeks leave at 100% paid salary. You may also choose to take an
additional 8 weeks leave unpaid as the primary or secondary caregiver. This time is meant for bonding with the new child
and should commence from the date of birth or placement.

Some states require us to provide additional [](stateFMLA.md)benefits.

## Perks

### Fitness Allowance

Box Products will pay up to \$100/month for your gym membership, yoga studio membership, or whatever activity you do to
stay in shape. If it's not organized fitness, that's okay, too. You can use your stipend to pay for race registrations
or even new outdoor running shoes. The only catch is that you can't "save up" your stipend. Sorry, but no saving 9
months worth of fitness benefit, and buying a new bike; this benefit is meant to promote regular activity for you.

### Wellness Allowance

Every month, you can expense up to \$100 towards a service or experience that enhances your overall mental well-being.
For some people that might mean a monthly massage. For others, that could be alternative medical treatments like
acupuncture or reiki. You could also use the stipend to defray your existing talk therapy co-pays, go on a wellness
retreat, take a meditation class, attend a religiously-affiliated retreat, or book a service at a spa that is more
relaxing _to you_ than a massage like a pedicure or facial. Box Products does not want to limit what is healing to
you, so get creative with your self-care! If you have questions about what qualifies here, feel free to ping Jonathan.

### Continuing Education Allowance

If you're interested in taking classes that you feel improve you professionally or personally, you have a \$1,000 annual
stipend to do so (annual = a 12 month period, not necessarily 2017 or 2018). Some people take classes directly related
to their career, while some take photography lessons or learn a musical instrument. It's up to you; the point is to
learn something that you feel enriches you as a person and employee.

## Practical assistance

### Home Office Set-up

Since you work remotely, we want to make sure your home office is comfortable. You can expense up to \$1,000 to furnish
your home office, every three years.

### Co-working Space Stipend

Box Products will pay up to \$200/month for you to use towards renting co-working space in your city. Please make sure
you're using a true co-working space that's meant solely for working, not a club or social space.
