## Paid Time Off

Overgrad offers 3 weeks of paid vacation, a few extra personal days to use at your discretion, and the standard national holidays every year. This is a guideline, so if you need a couple extra days, no problem. We don’t track your days off; we use the honor system. Just make sure to check with your team before taking any extended absence.

We don't track sick days either. If you're under the weather, take the time you need to feel better.

## Sabbatical

Every three years, employees are eligible to take a one-month-long paid sabbatical. Just give a heads-up preferably three months in advance, so we can coordinate the work-load accordingly.

## Family Leave

If you are the primary caregiver of a new child, you can take up to 12 weeks leave at 100% paid salary. If you are the secondary caregiver of a new child, you can take up to 6 weeks leave at 100% paid salary. You may also choose to take an additional 8 weeks leave unpaid as the primary or secondary caregiver. This time is meant for bonding with the new child and should commence from the date of birth or placement.

## Continuing Education Allowance

If you're interested in taking classes that you feel improve you professionally, you have a $1,000 annual stipend to do so (annual = a 12 month period, not necessarily 2019 or 2020).

## Expense Account

All employees of Overgrad should carry a Brex Overgrad Mastercard. You can use the card for any work-related expenses, such as travel, software, or office supplies. If you have any doubts about whether or not to expense something, just ask. When you do buy something with the card, get a receipt! Take a photo of that receipt with the Brex app for autoprocessing. If you can’t use the Mastercard and have to use a personal card, send the receipt directly to Ryan for reimbursement.

Overgrad has no expense policy. We trust our employees to spend money wisely. If you’re booking a flight, you don’t need to buy the cheapest, 2-layover redeye; buy the convenient, well-priced seat. If you’re attending a conference on behalf of Overgrad, sure, Overgrad will buy your meals. Try to limit conference travel to once a year, and don't extend your hotel stay too far to either side of the conference schedule. If you have questions about what “spend it wisely” means, just ask!
