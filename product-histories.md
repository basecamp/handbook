## Basecamp

Basecamp. We love it so much, we named our company after it in 2014. On our website, we say _Basecamp is a private, secure space online where people working together can organize and discuss everything they need to get a project done. See it, track it, discuss it, act on it. Tasks, discussions, deadlines, and files - everything’s predictably organized in Basecamp_. But we want it to be more than that. In mid-2016, we decided to focus on helping small business owners manage their businesses and help alleviate growth and organizational pains they're facing. Project management was our bread and butter for over 15 years. But we were inspired by how we, internally, have used Basecamp to run Basecamp, and we want to extend that philosophy to our current customers and scores of brand-new customers.

But let's take a look back. In 2003, Basecamp was called 37signals and was a web design firm made up of 4 people. We always had work, but we were disorganized. With so many concurrent projects, things began to slip through the cracks. Projects dragged on too long. We dropped the ball on key deliverables. We had some major miscommunication. As many people even still do, we relied on email for everything. Things inevitably got lost, people get left out of conversations, there’s nowhere to go to see what’s left to do.

So we started looking for a project management tool. We tried a few tools, but they were complicated and didn't fit what we needed. Frustrated, we decided to build our own simple project management app. A few months later we had something ready, and we immediately started using this tool with our existing clients.

Lo and behold, our projects ran better! We regained the sense of order and calmness we’d been craving. And clients noticed - they really appreciated the improved communication and organization. Soon after, our clients started asking us what software we were using to run these projects. Turns out they wanted to use it for their own in-house projects! So, we polished it up and put it on the market. On February 5th, 2004, Basecamp was born, and within a year, Basecamp was generating more income for us than our web design business, so we shuttered the web design firm to focus solely on Basecamp. That original Basecamp is called Basecamp Classic, and it still retains quite a few loyal customers! In 2012, we released our second version of Basecamp, referred to as BCX.

Fast forward to 2014. We'd been feeling pulled in too many directions for too long. Campfire, Highrise, Backpack, and a host of other products were taking away from what we really wanted to do: maintain and improve Basecamp. So we spun off, sold, or otherwise sunset our ancillary products, and dedicated the entire company's efforts to Basecamp. We even changed our name from 37signals to Basecamp to reflect the new direction.  Finally, in 2015 we launched our third version of Basecamp, called BC3.

## Highrise

When 37signals became Basecamp in 2014, we decided to spin off or sell our other (very successful!) applications. One of those was Highrise, our customer relationship management (CRM) tool. Highrise was by far the most popular of our non-Basecamp apps, so when we announced we were selling it, the offers poured in. After many long, lawyer-filled months, we were finally able to pass the company along to Nathan Kontny. Highrise is a subsidiary of Basecamp until it becomes fully funded by customer subscriptions, but it's been flourishing since Nate took over. Highrise is entirely separate from Basecamp now, in terms of its staff, board, and revenue.

## Campfire

In 2006, we built Campfire to help businesses communicate better. It’s a simple, real-time web-based group chat tool that lets people set up password-protected chat rooms super quickly. At the very beginning it didn’t integrate with Basecamp, but when it did it took off. Signups for Campfire were closed in February 2017.

## Know Your Company

In 2013, Basecamp created a software tool that allows managers to ask questions to gain insight into what their employees think about work, the culture, the direction of the company, what people are working on, or even something personal like their favorite recent movie. We created KYC because when the Basecamp team grew to about 30 people, Jason realized he didn't know the company or its people as well as he should have. So, KYC was created initially as an internal tool that eventually became a product that we sold to customers. In 2014, we [sold Know Your Company](https://knowyourcompany.com/story) to Claire Lew, and she's been running it ever since!

## Backpack

We created Backpack in 2005 as a supplement to Basecamp Classic. Backpack existed as an organizer: "a place to keep life's loose ends together". Users could make lists, notes, add files, upload pictures, and create Writeboards to share with other users. When we restructured in 2014, we closed Backpack to new customers, but existing customers still use (and love!) Backpack.

## Writeboard

A tool called Writeboards lives in Basecamp Classic and Backpack. A Writeboard functions as a very simple, minimally formattable text document. In October 2005, we launched Writeboards.com, so people who wanted to use the tool without a Basecamp or Backpack subscription could do so. When we became Basecamp in 2014, we retired Writeboards.com, but they still work in existing Basecamp Classic and Backpack accounts.

## Ta-da List

Ten years ago, to-do list apps were few and far between. So, we created Ta-Da List as a stand alone free subscription app at tadalist.com in January 2005. Now that people have to-do lists on their phones, desktops, laptops, tablets, and refrigerator doors, we recognized that Ta-Da List was a little outdated. We shuttered tadalist.com in 2014, but existing customers were able to retain their accounts.

## Breeze

In 2012, we launched Breeze, a mailing list tool for small groups. We were excited about it, tried for a year to build up the product and bring in customers, but the product didn’t take off like we hoped it would. Only about X customers signed up in that year, so rather than watch it limp along, we closed it down in August 2013.

Unlike our other retired products, we refunded our customers' money and closed the product entirely so not even existing customers could retain their subscription. We directed them to other small scale mailing list alternatives, and apologized for the hiccup.

## WeWorkRemotely.com

In 2014, Basecamp launched We Work Remotely. After Jason and David published their book REMOTE, we realized we wanted to be on the forefront of promoting remote work. So, we created and hosted WeWorkRemotely.com, which contains job postings for programmers, designers, marketing professionals, customer service representatives, writers, and more -- all remote work positions. To post a job, a company needs to fill out a form on our site with information about the job, pay Basecamp $200 for a 30 day posting, and then verify that they are in fact offering a remote job. We've posted over 3,500 jobs over the last few years. In Spring 2017, we sold We Work Remotely to Metalab, to cut down on manual labor taken to run the board and focus more on our core business - Basecamp!
