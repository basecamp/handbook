_A note about our Managers_. We encourage Managers to be "moonlight managers". To us that means they focus mostly
on product strategy, work, and communication, and they allow the individuals on their teams to self-direct.

At the same time, we ask our Managers to take on a lot of responsibility for their teams! We very much appreciate that
that may result in Managers doing some emotional labor. That sort of work is usually invisible and hard to quantify in
the way product work is, and that's okay! It's part of a Manager's tough job, and we see that.

Managers who feel that their energy for product work is _consistently_ suffering as a result of people management
means
something is structurally failing at Box Products. Those managers should raise the issue with Jonathan so we can all
work on fixing the root problem.
