Figuring out who to bring a particular issue or question to shouldn’t be a guessing game. Most concerns fall pretty clearly within the responsibility of a specific team at Box Products, and the head of that team should be the first point of contact. At the same time, every single person who works at Box Products is approachable and friendly, more than willing to point you in the right direction. If you have a question, you're probably not the first, so speak up!

For now, our team is small. The truth is we like it that way. That said, below is a list of the major groups and teams within the company. This is mostly hopeful definitions as we embark on our early stages. They're listed in alphabetical order by group name first and then, when relevant, by team. Inside groups/teams, people are listed in alphabetical order by last name, and the most senior people in a group/team are shown in bold.
