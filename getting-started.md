# Getting Started

## Expectations
Starting something new is hard. There are a lot of little details, a number of big tasks, and you're learning a new job and new coworkers. If you don't know how to set up your machine (or *why* you're setting up something on your machine!), please ask. We are here to help!

## Setting Up Your Machine
Before you start, Overgrad will order you a new laptop with the specs you request and any accessories you need, like an external keyboard, mouse, or monitor. Your manager will set up a Slack channel dedicated to your onboarding called "Welcome, [your name]!". When you start, you'll have access to that channel. In it, you'll see to-dos linking to accounts or services that you need to set up. You'll also see things that your manager will need to set up. Don't worry if you don't know what some of these services are. Anyone at Overgrad can help you through it.

If you have a specific training schedule or training milestones to complete, that will go into your Welcome channel, too.
