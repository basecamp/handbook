# Performance Feedback

At Overgrad, we value radical candor. That means we are consistently providing feedback that challenges directly and cares personally. Instead of letting problems fester, we humbly identify them and work to find solutions.

### Manager 1:1s
Once per cycle (6-8 weeks), you’ll meet with your manager for a 1:1 session. It's up to each manager to determine how best to approach that meeting, but we ask that whatever process they use, they use the same process for every team member. Managers should have a conversation with you about:
- your daily work content and load
- your overall work satisfaction
- your relationships with your team, manager, and company
- your thoughts about personal growth and how those impact your work at Overgrad

This is a two-way street! You should be offering your thoughts on these topics to your manager, and your manager should be giving you feedback about your performance in these areas. Managers will document your 1:1s along with any action items with deadlines that come out of the meeting.

### Feedback on Feedback
Both processes described above are constantly evolving (or at least they should be!). Great feedback opportunities can only be designed so much — it takes continual feedback on the process from everyone to keep it useful. If you think any aspect of the process described here could be more efficient, more practical, and result in better actionable feedback for you, please let Ryan and Kevin know!
