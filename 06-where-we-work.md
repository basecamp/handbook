# Where We Work

## From home

Most people at 37signals work from home most of the time. You can spend up to $2,000 during your first year at 37signals outfitting your home office. Getting the basics right will make a big difference: a good chair and a good desk.

## From coffee shops

Working from home all the time isn’t everyone’s cup of coffee. Lots of us choose to work from coffee shops or other third spaces either some of the time or a lot of the time. Great for a buzz of other people and caffeine, but please do mind our [staff security checklist](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/38/documents/5005159579) to ensure that nothing leaks on to the cafe WiFi.

## From a coworking space

If working from home or from a coffee shop doesn’t suit you, then trying a coworking space might just do the trick. 37signals offers a $200/month stipend towards a desk in such a place. We also offer all staff an account with [Deskpass](https://www.deskpass.com) if you need inspiration.
