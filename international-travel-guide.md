"Do I need a visa?"

"What do I say to the customs officer?"

"Can I bring my work laptop with me?"

If you travel out of the country for business purposes—to a company meetup or a professional conference—or even on a
family vacation with your work laptop, you're facing up to questions about business visitor visas, customs, and border
security.

We have answers!

## Traveling to the US

We'll focus on traveling to the US since attending company meetups is our primary reason for international business
travel.

Keep in mind, if you're traveling more than 10 hours in the air (not including layovers), Box Products will cover the
cost of a business class ticket, up to \$5000, twice a year.

When you travel for Box Products business, here's what you need:

1. A passport! Apply for one now if you don't have one already. Renew now if your passport expires in the next six
   months.
2. A travel visa or waiver.
3. An invitation letter that substantiates the purpose of your travel.
4. Your hotel address and contact info.
5. A security checklist for your laptop and phone. Clearing work data from your devices is _required_ before crossing
   the border.

## Visa

You need a visa (or a waiver!) to authorize travel to the US.

### Canadians

Canadian passport holders don't need a visa to enter the US for non-paid business events. Passport and government ID are
all that's required.

### Visa Waiver Program

If your country participates in the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), then you can apply for an ESTA (Electronic System for
Travel Authorization) within 3 days of travel. The ESTA is valid for 2 years.

[Apply for an ESTA here](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/)

### B-1 Business Visitor Visa

If your country does not participate in the Visa Waiver Program or you are not eligible for an ESTA, you'll need to
apply for a B-1 business visitor visa… the long way.

We'll work with you through this process. Start early, as soon as we have dates for a meetup or conference. Visa
appointments and processing can take weeks to months. Ping Jonathan as soon as you know that you'll need a visa.

### Trusted Traveler Programs

Border screening is slow and stressful every time. "Trusted traveler" programs expedite and bypass some screening.
Citizens of some countries are eligible for [Global
Entry](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry) and Canadians are
eligible for [NEXUS](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/nexus/nexus-eligibility). These programs are
completely optional but may make life a little easier, at the cost of onerous biometric scans like fingerprinting (for
Global Entry and NEXUS) and iris scanning (for NEXUS).

Note: An ESTA is still required for travel; these programs just speed up entry.

## Invitation Letter

To substantiate the purpose of your travel, we can provide an unofficial invitation letter that states that you're
traveling to the US for a business meeting and not to do work.

"Doing business"—e.g. attending a business meeting or conference—is allowed under the business visitor visa (and visa
waiver), but "doing work" is not. That'd require a temporary work visa.

## Company Security at the Border

When you enter the US, you may be asked to unlock your phone or laptop for search, possibly exposing sensitive company
data like source code, passwords, and customer account data. Yikes! We need to take some precautionary measures to
safeguard our data.

(What's a work device? Anything you have company data on: your laptop where you work with Box Products source code; your
tablet where you read Box Products email; your phone where you use the Box Products app; etc.)

### TL;DR: Don't Travel With Work Data

- If you don't need your work laptop (or tablet/phone), don't bring it with you!
- Wipe company data from your phone before crossing the border. Restore it afterward.

## Checklist: Before You Travel

- Let us know! Share your travel plans and when you expect to arrive in the US.
- Update your ESTA online with your travel info and the hotel address:\
  _Hampton Inn & Suites Colleyville, DFW West 5300 State Hwy 121, Colleyville, TX 76034\
  [+1 817 318 5000](+1 817 318 5000)_.

- Ensure you have your passport, ESTA, invitation letter, and travel details all in order.
- Put Jonathan and our attorney on speed dial.
- If you run into general travel issues or have any questions, contact Jonathan Simmons.
- If you're detained or encounter some other serious customs headache, contact our attorney directly: (get name and
  phone number from Jonathan). Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is not required to allow you to contact an attorney,
  but Jonathan is your first call if possible.
- 1Password:
    - Check that your personal 1Password vault doesn't have any work logins. If it does, move them to the Box Products team
  vault instead. You have a personal vault inside the Box Products team which is perfect for those logins.
    - Turn on Travel Mode. Go to https://box-products.1password.com/profile and click Enable Travel Mode.
    - Open 1Password on each device you're traveling with (laptop, phone, iPad, etc) so it can wipe its data while it's in
  Travel Mode.
- Email apps:
  - If you use an email app rather than Gmail in your browser, remove the @boxproducts.com account.
  - Clear browser cookies, logging you out of all work sites.
- Laptops: Clear cookies in Chrome, Safari, etc.
- [iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265): Settings > Safari > Clear History and Website Data
- [Android](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en): Chrome > Settings >
  Privacy > Clear browsing data. Check Cookies and site data; uncheck all the other items. > Clear data.
- Box Products source code:
  - Make an encrypted archive of your Box Products git repos so you can download and restore it after you're through
  customs.
  - Delete all Box Products source code from your laptop.
- Other sensitive documents:
  - Same deal as source code. Make an encrypted backup and remove from your laptop.
- Dropbox:
  - Log out of Dropbox and disconnect.
- Touch ID (optional):
  - Unlocking your device can be compelled at US border crossings, but other countries may be less intrusive, so it may
  make sense to make your device a little harder to unlock.
- Disable Touch ID / Face ID on your phone, tablet, and laptop. Require a passcode/password to unlock.

## Checklist: At Customs

- Have your passport, ESTA, invitation letter, and hotel address ready.
- Ensure your devices are charged up and turned on. Customs may balk at a bricked phone or laptop.
- Common questions:
- Purpose of your visit? Here for a business meeting in Dallas
- Here to do work? Nope! Here on business, meeting with Box Products.
- Where are you staying? Hampton Inn & Suites Colleyville DFW West 5300 State Hwy 121, Colleyville, TX 76034 +1 817 318  5000.

- Be straighforward and truthful. You're legit! No need to be cagey or misleading.

## Checklist: When You Arrive

- Let us know! Mention in the meetup Campfire when you're through customs and have arrived in the US.
- Touch ID: Reenable on your phone, tablet, and laptop.
- Dropbox: Log in and reconnect, but only if needed during travel.
- Box Products app: Reinstall on your phone, tablet, and laptop.
- 1Password: Turn off Travel Mode. Go to https://box-products.1password.com/profile and click Disable Travel Mode. Next
  time you open 1Password, you'll have full access again.
- Email apps: Add your @Box Products.com account again.
- Box Products source code: Download and restore the archive of your Box Products git repos, but only if needed during
  travel.
- Other sensitive documents: Download and restore, but only if needed during travel.

## Checklist: When You Return

Same as when you travel! Repeat the checklists for any border crossing, whether into or out of the US.
