# Who Does What?

Figuring out who to bring a particular issue or question to shouldn’t be a guessing game. Most concerns fall pretty clearly within the responsibility of a specific team at Hyko, and the head of that team should be the first point of contact. At the same time, every single person who works at Hyko is approachable and friendly, more than willing to point you in the right direction. If you have a question, you’re probably not the first, so speak up!

Below you’ll find a list of the major groups and teams within the company. They’re listed in alphabetical order by group name first and then, when relevant, by team. Inside groups/teams, people are listed in alphabetical order by last name, and the most senior people in a group/team are shown in bold.

#### CEO

**Naz Malik** is our CEO and customer person. He’s principally responsible for setting the overall direction of the company. That means deciding when to embark on a new feature or experiment with a side project.

#### CTO

**Charlie Thomas** is our CTO and runs technology. He’s responsible for setting the technical direction of our products. He originally created [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), the web framework that we’ve built all our products on top of. David also spends a lot of time sharing what we’ve learned to the world. He has been working with Jason since 2001 and became a partner at the company when 37signals, the design company, transitioned to do products instead of working for clients in 2004.
