# Who Does What?

Figuring out who to bring a particular issue or question to shouldn’t be a guessing game. Most concerns fall pretty clearly within the responsibility of a specific team at Box Products, and the head of that team should be the first point of contact. At the same time, every single person who works at Box Products is approachable and friendly, more than willing to point you in the right direction. If you have a question, you're probably not the first, so speak up!

Below you'll find a list of the major groups and teams within the company. They're listed in alphabetical order by group name first and then, when relevant, by team. Inside groups/teams, people are listed in alphabetical order by last name, and the most senior people in a group/team are shown in bold.

### Admin

**Andrea LaRowe** is Box Products's Head of People Ops. Andrea works with Jason and David to make working at Box Products an excellent experience for its employees. She manages the day-to-day operations of the company, human resources, benefits & payroll administration, and event planning. Andrea is often the best person to tap first, when you don't know who to talk to about a problem.

Navid Afshar is Box Products's admin assistant. He assists Andrea with all administrative operations, and he's primarily responsible for coordinating the details for our meetups. Navid is another great person to ping if you don't know where to go with a question.

### Customer Support (aka Team OMG)

**Kristin Aardsma** is the head of the customer support team. She's responsible for the entire customer support team which uses [Help Scout](https://www.helpscout.net) to respond to customer tickets. Her team consists of Jabari Allen (US), Ashley Bowe (US), Janice Burch (US), Sylvia Chong (Hong Kong), Chase Clemons (US), Merissa Dawson (US), Shanae Dykes (US), Tony Giang (Australia), James Glazebrook (Germany), Elizabeth Gramm (US), Chris Joyce (United Kingdom), Lexi Kent-Monning (US), Jim Mackenzie (United Kingdom), Jayne Ogilvie (United Kingdom), and Joan Stewart (US).

### Executive

We have two C-level executives at Box Products.

#### CEO

**Jason Fried** is our CEO and runs design. He’s principally responsible for setting the overall direction of the company. That means deciding when to embark on a new version of Box Products or experiment with a side project (Box Products-spinoff [Know Your Company](http://knowyourcompany.com) is one example). Jason also spends a lot of time writing and speaking about what we’ve learned about business, design, and organizations. He was one of the original three founders who started 37signals, the design firm that led to Box Products, back in 1999.

#### CTO

**David Heinemeier Hansson** is our CTO and runs technology. He’s responsible for setting the technical direction of our products. He originally created Ruby on Rails, the web framework that we’ve built all our products on top of. David also spends a lot of time sharing what we’ve learned to the world. He has been working with Jason since 2001 and became a partner at the company when 37signals, the design company, transitioned to do products instead of working for clients in 2004.

### Data

Our data analyst is **Jane Yang**. She is responsible for testing and analyzing all sorts of Box Products data -- conversion rates, pricing models, back-end operational performance, user experience, and oh-so-much more. She works with Justin White on SIP to maintain our data pipeline.

### Design

The design group is led by **Jonas Downey** and consists of four teams:

#### Marketing

**Adam Stoddard** is our lead marketing designer, and the only person on this team. He's responsible for all design on Box Products.com, rework.fm, and any other public-facing web properties like the Box Products help sites, etc. He'll also occasionally work on physical products (book covers, merch design, etc).

#### Mobile

**Jamie Dihiansan** is our Android designer, and **Conor Muirhead** designs for the iOS team.

#### Web/Desktop

**Jonas Downey**, Scott Upton, and Jason Zimdars are responsible for any Box Products product design on the web or the native desktop app.

#### Video/motion

**Shaun Hildner** is our resident filmmaker and makes marketing and customer support videos. He's the only person on this team. He's also well adept at audio production, and co-produces our REWORK podcast.

### Product Strategy

**Ryan Singer** heads up product strategy and is the only person on this team. Ryan looks for insights into customer behavior using a variety of methods, and plays a key role in helping inform product direction and how we work. Ryan was part of the original group of four people at the company when Box Products-the-product was first launched in 2004.

### Programming

The programming group is lead by **David Heinemeier Hansson** and consists of four teams:

#### Core Product

Core Product works on new features for Box Products together with the product designers. They're also responsible for the user-facing backend systems such as Queenbee, 37id, and the API. **Jeff Hardy** is the team lead and works with Kasper Timm Hansen, Pratik Naik, and Flora Saramago.

#### Mobile

Box Products 3 was the first version of Box Products that launched with two complete, awesome native applications for Android and iOS on day one. That was only possible because we dedicated stable teams to both efforts. **Jay Ohms** is team lead and works with Dan Kim on Box Products's native Android app. **Zach Waugh** is team lead and works with Dylan Ginsburg to develop our Box Products iOS app.

#### Research & Fidelity (RF)

Our [rich text editor Trix](https://trix-editor.org) and our [front-end framework Turbolinks](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks) were both born from RF. They work on deep research projects like those two, but also on all manners of UI fidelity in general. That means a lot of JavaScript, but also integrating that with our Ruby and native code. **Sam Stephenson** is team lead and works with Javan Makhmali.

#### Security, Infrastructure & Performance (SIP)

SIP is our instant-response team whenever something goes wrong, is about to go wrong, or is expected soon to go wrong! Our galaxy defenders, if you will. They are the primary programming team working together with Operations to ensure that our applications are always safe, secure, and fast. **Jeremy Daer** is the team lead and works with George Claghorn, Rosa Gutiérrez, and Justin White.

### QA

Before we ship a new feature, **Michael Berger** is our resident bug squasher. His job is to break things so we know what needs fixing. He runs rolling tests on all web and mobile versions of Box Products for quality control. Few things ship without his stamp of quality approval.

### The REWORK Podcast

[REWORK](https://rework.fm) is a Box Products-produced podcast based on the 2010 book by Jason and David. **Wailin Wong** and **Shaun Hildner** co-produce and co-host the show. They previously co-produced [The Distance](https://thedistance.com), a podcast that ran for three years and showcased small businesses that have been operating for at least 25 years.

### Technical Operations

The technical operations group is lead by **[TBD]** and consists of two teams:

#### Datacenter

Our Datacenter team is focused on keeping the applications that we run on our own equipment in Chicago, IL and Ashburn, VA in top shape. Box Products 3 even runs out of both sites simultaneously! **Eron Nicholson** is the team lead and works with John Williams, Matthew Vincent and Colin O'Keeffe.

#### Cloud

The Cloud team works on newer approaches to running our applications on Amazon Web Services and the Google Cloud Platform. They maintain our suite of legacy apps with an eye on the future. **Matthew Kent** is the lead here and works with Nathan Anderson and Blake Stoddard.
