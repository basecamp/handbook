 # What We Stand For

## Values

* **Wow our customers.** Every move we make is with our customers in mind. We listen to their needs and build tools they can’t get anywhere else. We need to know our customers inside and out to deliver an experience they could never have imagined.

* **Radical candor.** Every idea can be improved by thoughtful and respectful dialog. All opinions are welcome and all ideas (even the founders’) should be challenged. Employees should feel protected from ridicule or penalties when they share their ideas, feedback and constructive criticisms, and should assume good intent when others provide feedback and constructive criticisms.

* **Humble, hungry, and smart.**. Anyone that works at Overgrad must be a healthy balance of all three. If you are humble and smart, but not hungry, we will be blown away by the competition. If you are smart and hungry but not humble, then you are manipulative and destructive to the team. Someone who is in the middle of humble, hungry, and smart can put the customer’s needs first, design solutions, and celebrate our users' successes. We are enablers at Overgrad, so we need people who have a demonstrated track record of enabling others to thrive.

* **Generosity.** Generosity is a wonderful virtue. Being generous is surprising someone on the other end with goodwill and asking for nothing in return. It could be time, attention, or treasure - we give what we're expected to, and then some.

## Helping schools run an exceptional school counseling department

The best school counseling happens on a 1-to-1 basis. Unfortunately, the average US school counselor has over 475 students on their caseload. If a counselor spent 100% of their time with students, each student would still only, on average, get 2.5 hours of school counseling time a year.

To understand the individual achievement, goals, and aspirations of every student in your school is a near impossible task.

This is where Overgrad comes in.

Overgrad helps school counselors scale the excellent work they do, not replace it. Counselors know what is best for their students and our technology helps them deliver the personalized experience their students deserve.

This is what we do here. It is hard work, but if it wasn't hard it wouldn't be so fulfilling.
