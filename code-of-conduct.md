# Basecamp Code of Conduct

Basecamp pledges to be a company with a healthy and friendly work environment. What follows is a set of guidelines on how we get there.

Behavior that contributes to a healthy and friendly work environment:

- Using courteous language.
- Being respectful and empathetic, especially when it comes to differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism and direct feedback, as well as offering it in that spirit.
- Assuming good intentions. Approaching work relationships with a default of trust and positivity.

Unacceptable behavior:

- The use of any sexualized language or imagery.
- The use of any violent language or imagery.
- Making unwelcome sexual advances or giving unwanted sexual attention.
- Any form of discrimination and harassment. Particularly on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, marital status, citizenship, national origin, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by law.

These expectations apply to all current employees. Unacceptable employee conduct will not be tolerated virtually (e.g. in Basecamp, Github) or at in-person events.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness something that violates our Code of Conduct, please report it to your manager or to leadership via email or chat. All reports will be reviewed and investigated, and your confidentiality will be as protected as possible during the investigation.

If an employee is found to have violated our Code of Conduct, it will be permanently documented in their personnel file. Depending on the severity of the offense and the findings of the investigation, additional responses may include mandatory training, a formal reprimand, or even termination. The reactive measures taken will be shared with the reporting employee when possible.

In extreme circumstances, you can [report an incident anonymously](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/22311406/documents/4177996672). Anonymous complaints should be reserved for incidents in which you fear for your safety.

An important note: Most interpersonal conflicts do not rise to the level of a Code of Conduct report. If you find a colleague rude or difficult to work with, you should address that with your manager or better yet with that colleague directly. Code of Conduct reports are reserved for the kind of unacceptable behavior outlined above and other serious transgressions — illegal or egregiously unethical behavior.
