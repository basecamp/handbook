# Executive, Manager, and Individual Responsibilities

Basecamp has three tiers of responsibility within our job functions: Executive, Manager, and Individual. Here's how we break down each level’s duties.

## Executive Responsibilities

   * writing heartbeats and kick-offs (with input from team); providing status updates in between as needed
* people management: admin
   * formal performance evaluations for Managers twice a year
   * creating and tracking performance improvement plans for Managers as needed
* people management: personal
   * continually identifying and addressing potential performance problems in Managers or their team dynamic

## Manager Responsibilities

* product work and communication
   * making personal contributions to product work (programming, design, Ops, customer happiness)
   * writing heartbeats and kick-offs (with input from team) or contributing to Executive write-ups; providing status updates in between as needed

   * maintaining general cohesion of team (via 1:1s, group hangs, etc)

## Individual Responsibilities

   * contributing to heartbeats and kick-offs; providing status updates in between as needed
   * interpretation of daily work from the cycle strategy devised by Manager
* people management: personal
   * self-promotion and self-advocacy to Managers

*A note about our Managers*. We encourage Managers to be "moonlight managers". To us that means they focus mostly on product strategy, work, and communication, and they allow the individuals on their teams to self-direct.

At the same time, we ask our Managers to take on a lot of responsibility for their teams! We very much appreciate that that may result in Managers doing some emotional labor. That sort of work is usually invisible and hard to quantify in the way product work is, and that's okay! It's part of a Manager's tough job, and we see that.

Managers who feel that their energy for product work is _consistently_ suffering as a result of people management means something is structurally failing at Basecamp. Those managers should raise the issue with Jason, David, or Andrea so we can all work on fixing the root problem.
