# Managing work devices

Everyone receives a new laptop (Linux (default)[1], Mac or Windows depending on role and needs) [when they join 37signals](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/getting-started.md#your-first-few-days). 

## Linux

Default laptop option for the majority of employees and roles, currently unmanaged but expected to change soon.

The distro is Omarchy (O-march-ee), an opinionated Arch flavor.

## Mac

Macs are centrally managed and secured with [Kandji](https://kandji.io/) which reduces our exposure to security incidents. Kandji applies a standard configuration to every device (e.g. enable disk encryption, firewall, password rules), it installs essential apps (e.g. EncryptMe), and it will ensure the apps have the latest security updates applied. Kandji also allows us to remotely wipe devices should they be lost, or when an employee leaves the company.

This doesn’t mean you are being monitored or tracked! Kandji is a configuration management system, not a panopticon.

## Access to code and secrets

Knowing our devices are safe and secure allows us to entrust our work computers with access to sensitive systems like Queenbee, and our internal VPN and remote servers. This means installing the VPN, checking out 37signals code, and storing secrets must only be done on a managed work device, not a personal device.

Please do not keep any personal data on your 37signals-issued laptop. You should maintain a separate, personally-owned machine if you need a home computer. The company reserves the right to and may be required to confiscate your laptop or its data at any point.

## Mobile devices, Windows

Devices running Android, iOS/iPadOS or Windows are currently unmanaged. It’s fine to install our BC4 and HEY apps on these devices to access work projects and email, but since they’re unmanaged – and therefore ‘untrusted’ – it’s not okay to store 37signals code or secrets on them. If you're coding or accessing secure systems, you should be doing so on a company-managed laptop.

## FAQ

There are many questions that arise from IT policies such as this, so we've written [an FAQ in BC4](https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/31986799/documents/6044843594) to help answer them.
